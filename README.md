# Life Expectancy Prediction
The problem addressed by this project stems from the crucial challenge of accurately predicting life expectancy, as it holds significant implications for understanding population health dynamics, optimizing healthcare resource allocation, and formulating targeted interventions to improve overall well-being. With variations in life expectancy influenced by complex interactions of demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related factors, accurate prediction becomes paramount, especially in regions with limited access to healthcare services, high mortality rates, and significant health disparities. By developing a robust predictive model leveraging machine learning techniques and incorporating a wide range of relevant variables, this project aims to provide policymakers, public health practitioners, and healthcare providers with a valuable tool to forecast life expectancy more precisely, empowering evidence-based decision-making, resource planning, and the implementation of tailored interventions to promote healthier and more equitable communities.
